## Structured Data Project: Predicting the sale price of Bulldozer
# Overview
In this project, I am going to use machine learning with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers. it is going to be a regression problem since i want to  predict a number. 
I am going to use the evaluation metric ( root mean square log error or RMSLE)
