## Structured Data Project: Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment
# Overview
In this project, I am going to use machine learning with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers. it is going to be a regression problem since i want to predict a number. 
I am going to use the evaluation metric ( root mean square log error or RMSLE) 

# Data
I got the data from Kaggle websit: [Dataset Description](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)

The data is split into three parts 
* Train.csv : is the training set
* Valid.csv: is the validation set. This dataset is for the prediction throughout this project 
* Test.csv: is the final dataset I use to test the model.
